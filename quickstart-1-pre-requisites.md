# Pre-requisites

If you're deploying a cluster with kube-aws:

* [EC2 instances whose types are larger than or equal to \`t2.medium\` should be chosen for the cluster to work reliably](https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/kube-aws/issues/138)
* [At least 3 etcd, 2 controller, 2 worker nodes are required to achieve high availability](https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/kube-aws/issues/138#issuecomment-266432162)

Once you understand pre-requisites, you are \[ready to launch your first Kubernetes cluster\]\[aws-step-1\].
