# Getting Started

Deploy a fully-functional Kubernetes cluster using AWS CloudFormation.

Your cluster will be configured to use AWS features to enhance Kubernetes.

For example, Kubernetes may automatically provision an Elastic Load Balancer for each Kubernetes Service.

After completing this guide, a deployer will be able to interact with the Kubernetes API from their workstation using the `kubectl` CLI tool.
